# MCLogInCounter


A quick and dirty Python script to count the number of logins to a Minecraft server of each user.

This script reads Minecraft server log files from a /data directory and counts the number of times each
player has logged in.
It prints out the results in a formatted table as well as printing to the console.

Use run.bat to run the script.
